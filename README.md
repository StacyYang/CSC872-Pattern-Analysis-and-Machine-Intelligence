I. Face Recognition by Eigenface

Image I/O + visualization

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for learning

Recognition by nearest neighbor classification

II. Image Segmentation by Mean Shift

Use MeanShift for feature space analysis.

III. Classification of Facial Gender

Learn an LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) classifier that classifies input image (both gray image and color image) to either female or male (binary classification).
Use both PCA and LDA.
